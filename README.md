## How It Works

There are 2 applications within this repository, an Azure Function and an InnerApi.
The Durable Function responds to events, and the InnerApi responds to queries (e.g GET requests) as well as some commands to carry out actions such as price change requests.
All data is stored in a sql database

## ðŸš€ Installation

### Pre-Requisites

* A clone of this repository
* A code editor that supports .Net8
* Azure Storage Emulator (Azureite)
* Sql Server DB
* a ServiceBus namespace in azure

### Config

Most of the application configuration is taken from the [das-employer-config repository](https://github.com/SkillsFundingAgency/das-employer-config) and the default values can be used in most cases.  The config json will need to be added to the local Azure Storage instance with a a PartitionKey of LOCAL and a RowKey of SFA.DAS.Funding.ApprenticeshipEarnings_1.0.


# local.settings.json (For azure function)
```
{
  "IsEncrypted": false,
  "ConfigNames": "SFA.DAS.Encoding,SFA.DAS.Apprenticeships",
  "Values": {
    "AzureWebJobsStorage": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true",
    "AzureWebJobsServiceBus__fullyQualifiedNamespace": "<Your-Namespace>",
    "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "dotnet-isolated",
    "EnvironmentName": "LOCAL",
    "ConfigNames": "SFA.DAS.Encoding,SFA.DAS.Apprenticeships"
  }
}
```

## ðŸ”— External Dependencies

* Azure Storage Emulator (Azureite)
* Sql Server DB

The innerApi can be queried directly via a tool such as postman. The azure function can be triggered via a test publisher contained within the project
